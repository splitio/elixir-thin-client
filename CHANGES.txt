0.2.0 (February XX, 2025):
 - Added new variations of the get treatment functions to support evaluating flags in given flag set/s: `Split.get_treatments_by_flag_set`, `Split.get_treatments_by_flag_sets`, `Split.get_treatments_with_config_by_flag_set`, and `Split.get_treatments_with_config_by_flag_sets`.
 - BREAKING CHANGES:
    - Moved the `Split` struct into the new `Split.SplitView` module.
    - Removed the `fallback_enabled` option from the `Split.Supervisor.start_link/1` function. The fallback behavior is now always enabled.
    - Updated the return type of `Split` functions to never return `{:error, _}` tuples. Instead, they will use the fallback value when an error occurs.
    - Updated the return types of `Split.get_treatment/3` and `Split.get_treatments/3` to return the treatment string value and a map of treatment string values, respectively.
    - Updated the `Split` struct: renamed the `configurations` field to `configs`, the `flag_sets` field to `sets`, and added the `impressions_disabled` field.
    - Updated the signature of all get treatment functions: removed the 3rd argument (`bucketing_key`), and extended the first argument (`key`) to accept a union, allowing a string or a map with the key and optional bucketing key (`{:matching_key, String.t(), :bucketing_key, String.t() | nil}`).

0.1.0 (January 27, 2025):
 - BREAKING CHANGES:
    - Renamed `Split.Socket.Supervisor` module to `Split.Supervisor`, and updated the project structure to use a Context which is more in line to how Elixir libraries are structured (By @codeadict in https://github.com/splitio/elixir-thin-client/pull/17).
    - Refactored the options passed to the Split.Supervisor.start_link function to use Keywords instead of Maps to be more in line with other Elixir libraries and common practices (By @codeadict in https://github.com/splitio/elixir-thin-client/pull/17).

0.0.0 (January 21, 2025):
 - Initial public release.
