## Compatibility

The Elixir Thin Client SDK is compatible with Elixir @TODO and later.

## Getting started

### Installing from Hex.pm

The Split Elixir thin client is published as a package in hex.pm. It can be installed
by adding `split_thin_elixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:split, "~> 0.1.0", hex: :split_thin_sdk}
  ]
end
```

After adding the dependency, run `mix deps.get` to fetch the new dependency.

### Using the SDK

Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK. Keep in mind that Elixir SDK requires an [SplitD](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/18305269686157-Split-Daemon-splitd#local-deployment-recommended) instance running in your infrastructure to connect to.

```elixir
# Start the SDK supervisor
Split.Supervisor.start_link(socket_path: "/var/run/splitd.sock")

# Get treatment for a user
case Split.get_treatment(user_id, feature_flag_name) do
  "on" ->
    # Feature flag is enabled for this user
  "off" ->
    # Feature flag is disabled for this user
  _ ->
    # "control" treatment. For example, when feature flag is not found or Elixir SDK wasn't able to connect to SplitD.
end
```

Please refer to [our official docs](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/@TODO-Elixir-Thin-Client-SDK) to learn about all the functionality provided by our SDK and the configuration options available for tailoring it to your current application setup.
